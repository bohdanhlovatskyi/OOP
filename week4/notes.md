inheritence is about business maintanance of endpoints (that won't be much changed), and also some code hiding (a little bit %=))

in java inheritence: tree
in python: graph (as we have several inheritances possible (multiple inheritence))

think of super as a reference to parent class

overriding vs overeloading

it is always better to create abstract inteerface rather than its realisation:

Map<string, int> map 

rather than

HashMap<string, int>

class with parameters

they will be basically substituted with given types
