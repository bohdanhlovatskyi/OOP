- to distinguish long from int add suffix L at the end of number literal 

GC:
- markign (keeps track of references)
- normal deletion (keeps a list of references to free spaces)
- delection with compaacting (compacts remaining referenced objects)

char c = 'c' // 16 bit Unicode character 

Smaller data types, namely byte, short, and char, are first promoted to int any time theyâ€™re used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is int

arrays:
- binarySort
- equals method 
- fill method (fill all the indexes with specific values)
- parallelSort for large array (sorting of large arrays on multiprocessor systems)

- primitive types are passed by values, therefore we need wrappers

- classes in java.util handles only objects
- object  is needed to support synchronization in multithreading ???????/

!!! float literals are by default percepted as doubles

f1 += 1.0 will compilt
f1 = f1 + 1.0 will throw an error
